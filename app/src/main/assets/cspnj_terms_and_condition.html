    Content on or through the CSPNJ Services, you hereby grant to CSPNJ a limited license
    to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and
    distribute such Content solely on or through the CSPNJ Services, including without
    limitation distributing part or all of the CSPNJ Website in any media formats and through
    any media channels, except Content marked "private" will not be distributed outside the
    CSPNJ Website. This limited license does not grant CSPNJ the right to sell or
    otherwise distribute your Content outside of the CSPNJ Services. After you remove your

    "private," we will cease distribution of such "private" Content outside the CSPNJ Website
    as soon as practicable after you make the change.
    <br/>
    The license you grant to CSPNJ is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your
    Content to anyone else in addition to CSPNJ), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that
    CSPNJ is not required to pay you for the use on the CSPNJ Services of the Content that
    you post), sublicensable (so that CSPNJ is able to use its affiliates, subcontractors and
    other partners such as Internet content delivery networks and wireless carriers to provide the

    in reach).
    You represent, warrant and covenant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through
    the CSPNJ Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this

    entity by reason of any Content posted by you on or through the CSPNJ Services.
    The CSPNJ Services contain Content of CSPNJ ("CSPNJ Content"). CSPNJ Content
    is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, industrial secret, and other laws,
    and CSPNJ owns and retains all rights in the CSPNJ Content and the CSPNJ
    Services. CSPNJ hereby grants you a limited, revocable, non sublicensable license to
    reproduce and display the CSPNJ Content (excluding any software code) solely for your
    personal use in connection with viewing the CSPNJ Website and using the CSPNJ
    Services.
